# NOTE: The purpose of this workflow is only to test if Docker images build
# successfully.
# Oasis recommends using binaries from the official GitHub releases as described
# in repo's docker/README.md.

# Trigger the workflow when:
on:
  # A push occurs to one of the matched branches.
  push:
    # XXX: ideally on master branches we would build the image only if there are changes in the
    # 'docker/' directory (as we do in pull_requests). However, this doesn't work when pushing a new
    # 'stable/*' branch - the build on a new branch does not trigger unless there are changes
    # compared to master on the filtered path.
    # If this is ever fixed, or per branch filters are possible, bring back the path filter to only
    # build the image when there are changes within 'docker/' directory.
    branches:
      - master
      - stable/*
  # Or when a pull request event occurs for a pull request against one of the matched branches and at least
  # one modified file matches the configured paths.
  #
  # NOTE: We use this to be able to easily test Docker image changes.
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - master
      - stable/*
    paths:
      - docker/**
  # Or every day at 04:00 UTC (for the default/master branch).
